<h3 data-start="697" data-end="718">Market Definition</h3>
<p data-start="720" data-end="1412"><a href="https://straitsresearch.com/report/edible-films-and-coatings-market">Edible films and coatings</a>are thin, edible layers applied to food products to enhance their shelf life, improve product safety, and preserve freshness. These films serve as a protective barrier that helps prevent moisture loss, oxidation, and microbial contamination. Made from a variety of natural ingredients such as polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and edible fibers, these films are most commonly used in the food industry for packaging, coating, and extending the shelf life of fresh produce, dairy, and baked goods. The ability of edible films and coatings to be consumed or biodegrade without contributing to environmental pollution is a key factor driving their increasing adoption.</p>
